# Glove-for-deaf

•Deaf use the sign language to be in touch with surrounding people, unfortunately, the  people must learn or know the sign language to connect with them. 

•So, we will implement a device that can transcript the sign word on LCD: 
  Five flexible sensors must be put on all fingers respectively. 
  Flexible sensors fast response detect any motion of fingers. 
  According to the posture of fingers, the relative meaning will be printing on the LCD. 

By using MC ATmega32A:
  1.They are used to detect any motion of fingers, every finger must has an individually one.
  2.According to the position of pack of fingers, the relative word will be printed on LCD.
